Title: AUTOMATIC CELL SEGMENTATION TO ANALYSE SINGLE CELL HETEROGENEITY BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES

OBJECTIVE
1. To perform automatic segmentation and extract multiple morphological features from cells using MATlab.
2. To elucidate the single cell heterogeneity among the cells based on shape and morphological features.
3. To compare between single cell and overlapped cells in a image and infer the changes.
